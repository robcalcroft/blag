**I originally wrote this blog for Opsview and the original version can be [found here](https://www.opsview.com/resources/blog/intern-full-time-employee-industrial-placement-success-story)**

I started at Opsview in 2014 for my placement year at university. I began in Customer Success, learning about many aspects of DevOps, from server and virtual machine provisioning to LDAP maintenance and interaction. After a few months, I was picked up to move into the Engineering department to help build Opsview 5.0.

This was a great chance to put a lot of software engineering concepts I learned at university into practice. It was great to see how relevant the skills I learned were in a real world environment. We worked in an Agile environment for software development, something that Iâ€™d heard of but never been a part of. Having that year of Agile experience was great as it allowed me to apply those same concepts to my final year project work.

At the end of my placement year, Opsview offered to have me back after I finished my studies and of course, I accepted! I was invited along to the Christmas party and a couple of other events during my final year of university, which was a great chance to catch up with everyone and share my experiences from a busy final year!

It was a real help to me during my final year knowing that I had a placement secured, as I saw far too many people worried about both their studies AND finding a job at the end of the year; a worry that I thankfully, did not have.

Joining the company again was super easy and I found settling in to be a breeze. It was great to see a lot of old faces and meet a few new ones too!
